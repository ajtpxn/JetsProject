## Jets Project

### This is my favorite Jets Project

How to run this program:

1. Download all the files in the folder called "src/com/skilldistillery/jets/" that end with .java
2. Start a terminal (shell)
3. Compile all the .java files using the Java 8 compiler (ie Java 1.8, javac filename.java)
4. Run in the terminal with "java com.skilldistillery.jets.JetsApplication"
5. After that it should be pretty self explanatory

Here is what the source folder you will be downloading should look like on GitHub:

Here is what the overall architecture of the program looks like in UML:
